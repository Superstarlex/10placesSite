                         <p class="p11"><b>The People's Republic of China, or just China, is a country in East Asia. As 
                              of September 2020, China has a huge population of 1.4 billion people and spans across 
                              five geographical time zones.</b></p>
                         <p class="p12"><b>Chinese people just speak Chinese or Mandarin. There are others such as 
                              Yue, Wu, Minbei, Minnan, Xiang, Gan and Hakka. Some regions in China also have their own 
                              dialects.</b></p>
                         <p class="p13"><b>China has a total of 56 ethnic groups. Of those groups, the Han, has 91% of 
                              the population. Of the smaller groups, Zhuang, Manchu, Hui, and Miao have the largest 
                              populations. Most of the smaller groups have their own very distinct culture. Some of 
                              them also have their own languages and writing system.</b></p>

                         <p class="p21"><b>Beijing, China's sprawling capital, has history dating back millennia. It's
                              known as much for modern architecture as its ancient sites such as the grand Forbidden 
                              City complex, the imperial palace during the Ming and Qing dynasties. Nearby, the 
                              massive Tiananmen Square pedestrian plaza is the site of Mao Zedong’s mausoleum and the 
                              National Museum of China, displaying a huge collection of cultural relics.</b></p>
                         <p class="p22"><b>The city remained the most flourishing cultural centre in China despite the
                              frequent political changes in the country throughout the early decades of the 20th century;
                              Beijing’s importance was fully realized, however, only when the city was chosen as the 
                              capital of the People’s Republic in 1949, and this political status has added much vitality 
                              to it. Indeed, few cities have ever had such rapid growth in population and geographic area, 
                              as well as in industrial and other activities.</b></p>

                              people as being more "cold" than you are used to, this should not be interpreted as rudeness. 
                              A coconut culture is one where people present a formal exterior and close friendships are 
                              earned over time. Chinese people may present a stony exterior, but they are just as kind 
                              and welcoming as any other culture. </b></p>
                         <p class="p32"><b>Chinese people gave their own stereotypes about foreigners that might impact 
                              your relationships. For example, many in China believe that all foreigners are wealthy. 
                              If you're American, you might be asked things like whether you own a gun and if you eat 
                              a lot of hamburgers. Keep this in mind as you plan your journey and get ready to become
                              a bit of an ambassador during your travels.</b></p>
